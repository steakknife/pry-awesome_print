# pry + awesome_print

This gem is only marginally useful but it adds pagination.  If you want a batteries-included pry, try [spirit_hands](https://github.com/steakknife/spirit_hands).

## Install
## `gem install pry-awesome_print`

### Public cert for `gem install -P HighSecurity` (pry isn't signed yet)
#### `gem cert --add <(curl -kL http://git.io/steakknife_gem_public_cert)`

## Usage
There's nothing to configure.  This gem mimics `AwesomePrint.Pry!` with the exception that pagination works.

In fact, remove the `require 'awesome_print'  AwesomePrint.Pry!` from ~/.pryrc. 

## Patches Welcome!

If they're obviously beneficial.
